# Doom game engine
Pseudo 3D basic game engine written in Python using Pygame to create Doom-like video games.
This project is a personal challenge to learn more about game development and 3D rendering, if you want to see my other projects, you can visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/archibald-carrion).

## Dependencies
This code was written in Python 3.10.6, and uses the following libraries:
-pygame 2.1.2

The program also use other python modules such as:
-os
-sys
-math
-time
-random

But these modules are included in the Python standard library, so you should not have to install them.

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage
To run the program, you can use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Or you can build th program using pyinstaller:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile -w main.py
```
But you will need to install pyinstaller first:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
